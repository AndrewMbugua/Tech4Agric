Quick instructions

-click upload button to upload the to ESP32
-plant the moisture sensor into the soil
-irrigate the soil slowly
-see the results in the serial monitor
-write down a value at the time you feel that the soil changes its moisture from dry to wet.this value is called threshold value


--Now after the  calibration update the threshold value you wrote down to the code below.


--i recommend Capacitive moisture sensor because it doesnt corrode over time
