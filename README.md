### Welcome to Tech4Agric
The purpose of this open source project to develop a smart farming system. This includes using of various field sensors e.g temperature sensor, soil pH sensor, humidity sensor and actuators like a water pump.

The goal would be to enable the farmer plan his/her planting in good time. The farmer would also be able to monitor and evaluate his farm conditions on a personalised website. There, they can look at charts and graphs produced by the various sensors in the field and take action from the click of a button.

You are welcomed to join us in the development of this project that will surely help others who are learning about using certain technologies for their own skills development or for their own smart farm projects.

Thank you all!
